# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic prioritization for the Delhi Pollution Live Map project, focused on pinpointing precise locations of emissions to enable community action.

## Core Mission
To build an online public service that pinpoints precise locations of emissions, enabling communities and groups to take targeted action.

## Prioritization Matrix

The development roadmap is structured by **Region** (Coverage), **Time** (Frequency), and **Data Depth** (Emissions), following the client's ordered prioritization.

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Delhi City)
The initial focus is on establishing the platform within Delhi City with high reliability for main pollutants.
- **Coverage**: Delhi City.
- **Frequency**: Monthly & Weekly reports/views (Historical Analysis).
- **Emissions**: SPM 2.5 and PM 10.
- **Goal**: Identify and verify "hotspots" of emissions to allow for initial community engagement.

### Phase 2: Expansion (NCR)
Once the core model is proven in Delhi, we expand the geographic scope and increase temporal resolution.
- **Coverage**: National Capital Region (NCR).
- **Frequency**: Daily updates.
- **Emissions**: SPM 2.5 and PM 10 + initial Major Gases integration.
- **Goal**: Provide more timely data to a wider population, facilitating faster response times.

### Phase 3: Regional & Real-Time (NorthWest India)
The final phase achieves the full vision of a real-time, comprehensive monitoring system across the broader region.
- **Coverage**: NorthWest India (Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Northern Rajasthan, West UP).
- **Frequency**: Real Time (Live Streaming Data).
- **Emissions**: SPM 2.5, PM 10, and all Major Polluting Gases.
- **Goal**: A fully "live" oversight mechanism that allows for immediate detection and intervention across the entire airshed.

## Precision Note
> "Precision (extent of emission): We are quite flexible on this one."

While the client is flexible on precision, the technical goal is to be as precise as the available data (official stations + citizen reports) allows, aggregating where necessary to maintain accuracy without misleading users.
